# Data Mining algorithms

Some implementations of data mining algorithms.

None of these has been invented by myself. These are implementations.

Most of these were developed when writting:
* R. Cruz, K. Fernandes, J. S. Cardoso, and J. F. P. Costa. [Tackling Class Imbalance with Ranking](http://vcmi.inescporto.pt/reproducible_research/ijcnn2016/ClassImbalance/). In International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN). IEEE, 2016

They were written with the supervision of [Kelwin Fernandes](https://github.com/kelwinfc) and James S. Cardoso.
